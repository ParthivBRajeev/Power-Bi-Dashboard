## Final Conclusion
The project analysis reveals several key insights into customer retention and behavior. Women customers are more likely to be retained compared to men, with a retention rate of approximately 65%. The top three countries contributing to customer base are France, Germany, and Spain. The adult age group (25-49 years) is the most active, contributing the most and using the widest range of products. Credit cards are the most popular payment method among customers. Importantly, over 40% of customers are identified as retainable. These findings highlight the importance of targeting women, focusing on key European markets, and catering to the needs of the adult age group to maximize customer retention and loyalty.
